## Abstract: 
"DarkSky: Your Nightly News Reader" is an  application designed to cater to the modern news reader's preferences for reading at night. With an intuitive dark mode interface, it minimizes screen glare and enhances the reading experience during the evening or in low-light environments. The app features a seamless, real-time search field that allows you to sift through a multitude of news articles with ease.

Upon selecting an article on the home screen, you are directed to a dedicated page that provides a more detailed view of the article. This page is thoughtfully designed to offer a summary and for those seeking the full story, a direct link is provided to read the article on the original website. This app is also responsive on small, medium, and large screens; therefore, you can enjoy this on your phone, tablet, laptop and desktop.

DarkSky ensures you can always find your way back home with intuitive navigation features. If you get lost and accidentally go down a bad route, you can easily navigate your way back home and continue reading!

## Installation Instructions:

## Context:
- I am a student of Turing School of Software and Design's 7-month program. This project was completed during my intermission break transitioning from Mod 3 to Mod 4. I created a news reader application that pulls articles from the [NEWS API](https://newsapi.org/). This app is responsive on small, medium, and large screens.


## Wins & challenges:
This was the first time I implemented and completed a search bar with React. Although there were moments where I was stuck, I was able to troubleshoot and fix the problem before having to reach out for help. I learned how to better execute Cypress e2e testing through practice and was able to complete the project faster and more efficiently compared to the first week of Mod 3. Although I was stuck on Cypress because the images were different compared to my previous projects, I was able to try a different way and was able to get the tests to pass for the images.
